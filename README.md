All cards are face-down.  
Click any two cards to flip them.

**2. Match Logic**  
If the images match, a pop-up says: `"You've got a match!"` and the cards turn black.  
If they don‚Äôt match, a pop-up says: `"Sorry, try again!"` and the cards flip back.

**3. Win Condition**  
Once all 6 pairs are matched, a message appears:  
`"Congratulations, you've found them all!"`
